It looks at the COVID-19 positive cases and COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations in the US. The chart is designed to be interactive. Hovering on elements in the charts provide details regarding the highlighted state. 

 This visualization was developed as part of an assignment for the class Information Visualization (CS 7450) with Prof. John Stasko at Georgia Institute of Technology. Given a dataset, we were tasked with designing and developing 3 visualizations in D3.js \u2014 a scatter plot, a bar chart and a line chart.`,languages:["D3.js","HTML","CSS"],source:"The COVID Tracking Project",sourceLink:"https://covidtracking.com/data/download",github:"https://github.com/aishwaryamsk/covid-19_visualization",demoLink:"https://aishwaryamsk.github.io/covid-19_visualization/index.html"},vast2022:{title:"IEEE-VIS VAST Challenge-3 2022",imgSrc:"./images/vast_cover.jpg",shortDescription:"Visualizing the economic sector of Engagement city, Ohio",longDescription:`This was a submission for the Visual Analytics, Science and Technology (VAST) challenge at IEEE-VIS 2022. I worked on mini-challenge 3 that investigated the economic sector of Engagement city at Ohio, USA. Based on data taken from a study, as well as information provided by participants over a period of months, the challenge asks to analyze the participants\u2019 finances and business trends in the city. 

 The first graph looks into individual participants\u2019 background and finances. And the second graph takes a look into business prosperity. Taking a creative approach to the challenge, I used hues, shapes, sizes, textures, and proximity to represent various features of the dataset.`,languages:["D3.js","HTML","CSS","Python"],source:"IEEE-VIS",challengeLink:"https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/index.html",github:"https://github.com/aishwaryamsk/vast-challenge-2022",demoLink:"https://aishwaryamsk.github.io/vast-challenge-2022/economics.html"},mostCommonObjsInPaintings:{title:"20 Most Common Objects in Paintings",imgSrc:"./images/paintings_cover.jpg",shortDescription:"Visualizing 20 most common objects in paintings",longDescription:`This is a personal project where I visualized the 20 most common objects in paintings since in the 1800s. The objects in the paintings were detected using the Google Cloud Vision API. 

 Moving in a clockwise direction from the top, the labels in the donut chart go in decreasing frequency of the objects painted. The inner curve marks the selected object. The strokes around the donut chart represent paintings that contain the object. Clicking on the labels in the donut chart highlights the object. Hovering or clicking on the strokes around the donut chart shows details regarding the painting.

The choropleth map shows the average state sentiment towards COVID-19 during the selected period. A range slider allows users to specify the duration they are interested in. 

 The objective of this project was to understand how COVID-19 related government policies affects people\u2019s well-being. This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize how different policy choices in the US affects the overall sentiments of tweets, which are computed using state-of-the-art transformer-based methods.
